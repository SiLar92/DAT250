No technical issues encountered during installation, setup or use of MongoDB.


### Screenshots for:
#### The correct validation of the installation package https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/

#### Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant from each CRUD operation).

#### Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you.

### Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.

### Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve
